* Steganography

  Steganography is the technique of hiding information inside a file.

* LSB

  LSB is a steganography method which encodes a file into the least
  significant bits of each byte of another file.

* Compilation

  Simply use

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make
  #+END_SRC

* Usage

  LSB can work in two directions:

** Hide something into a file

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
./lsb -c input_file containter_file output_file
  #+END_SRC

   This mode will hide input_file into container_file and store the
   result in output_file

** Read the hidden message in a file
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
./lsb -o  containter_file
     #+END_SRC

   This mode will print to standard output the file hidden in
   container_file
